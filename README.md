# The-RAP-Algorithm

# Programming Language of choice
The programming language we are using for the RAP Algorithm is Julia. You can find a full documentation and a link to download Julia here: https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/

You will need to add Julia to your path. To do this, find how Julia is called on your computer by entering the following command into your command line tool and searching for Julia:

$ is -a /Applications/

Let’s assume the name for Julia in your computer is “Julia-1.8.app”. Then, enter the following commands into your command line tool: 

$ sudp mkdir -p/usr/local/bin <br />
$ sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/Julia <br />
$ sudo ln -s/Applications/Julia-1.8.app/Contents/Resources/Julia/bin/  Julia/usr/local/bin/julia$ <br />


You will also need to install Jupyter Notebooks, which is a web-based interactive development environment to run the code. A guide to installing Jupyter notebooks can be found here: https://jupyter.org/install

After installing Julia and Jupyter notebooks, you can open the latter by running the following command in your terminal:

$ bash jupyter notebook

This should open a Jupyter notebook tab in your default browser.
On the page, navigate to the folder where the file to the RAP Algorithm is located and open the code selecting a Julia Kernel.
